Hostel Management System
Overview

The Hostel Management System is designed to streamline and simplify the management of a hostel. The system facilitates different user roles, such as Admin, Staff, and Customer, allowing them to manage and interact with various functionalities like booking rooms, managing staff details, and handling customer reservations.

The system utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, separating the application logic into models (business logic), views (user interface), and controllers (request handling). The project was developed as part of the CSC584 Enterprise Programming course.
